## About

Dipping my toes in Copmuter Science waters during COVID-19 crisis!  
This repo contains the problem sets (assignments) as part of [Harvard's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming.](https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science/) The assignments are coded, run, tested, and submitted by using [Harvard's CS50 IDE](https://ide.cs50.io/). The CS50 IDE is a cloud-based programming environment that includes CS50's own libraries, such as cs50.h.
